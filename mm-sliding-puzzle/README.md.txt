-To open the puzzle, double-click the index.html.
-Not supported on internet explorer due to the grid-template-areas CSS property.
-Made a 3x3 version besides the 4x4 for convenience when manually testing and completing the puzzle.
-Due to time constraints and short code length, the code is in plain JS instead of TS and all the logic is in a single JS file.
-Enhanced image quality for aesthetic purposes.
-MediaMonks svg and favicon are custom made.
